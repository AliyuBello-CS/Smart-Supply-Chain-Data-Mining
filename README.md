# Smart-Supply-Chain-Data-Mining
The “Smart Supply Chain” project uses R for data mining and visualization on supply chain data. It includes key analyses like histograms, discriminant analysis, clustering (K-means and hierarchical), PCA for dimensionality reduction, and outlier detection, all aimed at identifying patterns to enhance supply chain efficiency and insights.
